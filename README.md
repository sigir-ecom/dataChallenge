# Description
This challenge focuses on the topic of large-scale taxonomy classification where the goal is to predict each product’s category as defined in the taxonomy tree given product's title. The cataloging of product listings through taxonomy categorization is a fundamental problem for any e-commerce marketplace, with applications ranging from personalized search recommendations to query understanding. For example, in the Rakuten.com catalog, “Dr. Martens Air Wair 1460 Mens Leather Ankle Boots” is categorized under the “Clothing, Shoes & Accessories -> Shoes -> Men -> Boots” leaf. However, manual and rule based approaches to categorization are not scalable since commercial product taxonomies are organized in tree structures with three to ten levels of depth and thousands of leaf nodes. Advances in this area of research have been limited due to the lack of real data from actual commercial catalogs. The challenge presents several interesting research aspects due to the intrinsic noisy nature of the product labels, the size of modern eCommerce catalogs, and the typical unbalanced data distribution.
